# GatewayD Plugin Configuration

# The compatibility policy controls how GatewayD treats plugins' requirements. If a plugin
# requires a specific version of another plugin, the compatibility policy controls whether to
# allow or reject the plugin.
# - "strict" (default): the plugin is rejected if it requires a specific version of another
#   plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.
# - "loose": the plugin is allowed to run even if it requires a specific version of another
#   plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.
compatibilityPolicy: "strict"

# The metrics policy controls whether to collect and merge metrics from plugins or not.
# The Prometheus metrics are collected from the plugins via a Unix domain socket. The metrics
# are merged and exposed via the GatewayD metrics endpoint via HTTP.
enableMetricsMerger: True

# The metrics merger period controls how often the metrics merger should collect and merge
# metrics from plugins.
metricsMergerPeriod: 5s

# The health check period controls how often the health check should be performed. The health
# check is performed by pinging each plugin. Unhealthy plugins are removed.
healthCheckPeriod: 5s

# If the plugin crashes, should GatewayD restart it? The crash is detected by the health check.
reloadOnCrash: True

# The timeout controls how long to wait for a plugin to respond to a request before timing out.
timeout: 30s

# The start timeout controls how long to wait for a plugin to start before timing out.
startTimeout: 1m

# The policy timeout controls how long to wait for the evluation of the policy before timing out.
policyTimeout: 30s

# The action timeout is the default timeout for actions that do not specify a timeout themselves.
actionTimeout: 30s

# action redis configures a Redis connection for the async actions to be published to.
actionRedis:
  address: ${REDIS_URL}  # Use environment variable for Redis URL
  channel: gatewayd-actions

# The policy is a list of policies to apply to the signals received from the plugins.
policies: []

# The plugin configuration is a list of plugins to load. Each plugin is defined by a name,
# a path to the plugin's executable, and a list of arguments to pass to the plugin. The
# plugin's executable is expected to be a Go plugin that implements the GatewayD plugin
# interface via the GatewayD plugin SDK using gRPC. The args field is optional and is passed
# as command line arguments to the plugin's executable. The env field is used to pass extra
# environment variables to the running instance of the plugin. The MAGIC_COOKIE_KEY and
# MAGIC_COOKIE_VALUE environment variables are used to verify the identity of the plugin and
# are required. The env field is optional if the MAGIC_COOKIE_KEY and MAGIC_COOKIE_VALUE are
# hardcoded in the plugin's executable. The checksum field is mandatoryy and is used to verify
# the integrity of the plugin's executable. The checksum is a SHA256 hash of the plugin's
# executable. Checksum verification will change in the future for better security and automation.
# The DEFAULT_DB_NAME environment variable is used to specify the default database name to
# use when connecting to the database. The DEFAULT_DB_NAME environment variable is optional
# and should only be used if one only has a single database in their PostgreSQL instance.
